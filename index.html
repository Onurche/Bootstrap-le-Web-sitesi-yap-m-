						<h1>Norse Mythology</h1>
						<p>
							Norse or Scandinavian mythology is the body of myths of the North
							Germanic peoples, stemming from Norse paganism and continuing
							after the Christianization of Scandinavia, and into the
							Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost
							extension of Germanic mythology and stemming from Proto-Germanic
							folklore, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities,
							beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before
							and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts,
							archaeological representations, and folk tradition. The source
							texts mention numerous gods, such as the hammer-wielding,
							humanity-protecting thunder-god Thor, who relentlessly fights his
							foes; the one-eyed, raven-flanked god Odin, who craftily pursues
							knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the
							runic alphabet; the beautiful, seiðr-working, feathered cloak-clad
							goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among the slain; the
							vengeful, skiing goddess Skaði, who prefers the wolf howls of the
							winter mountains to the seashore; the powerful god Njörðr, who may
							calm both sea and fire

						<h1>Egyptian Mythology</h1>
						<p>
							Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt,
							which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of
							understanding the world around them. The beliefs that these myths
							express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths
							appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in
							short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual
							texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. These sources rarely
							contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief
							fragments. Inspired by the cycles of nature, the Egyptians saw
							time in the present as a series of recurring patterns, whereas the
							earliest periods of time were linear. Myths are set in these
							earliest times, and myth sets the pattern for the cycles of the
							present. Present events repeat the events of myth, and in doing so
							renew maat, the fundamental order of the universe. Amongst the
							most important episodes from the mythic past are the creation
							myths, in which the gods form the universe out of primordial
							chaos; the stories of the reign of the sun god Ra upon the earth;
							and the Osiris myth, concerning..
