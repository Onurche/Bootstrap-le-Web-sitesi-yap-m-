						<p>
							Egyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient Egypt,
							which describe the actions of the Egyptian gods as a means of
							understanding the world around them. The beliefs that these myths
							express are an important part of ancient Egyptian religion. Myths
							appear frequently in Egyptian writings and art, particularly in
							short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual
							texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. These sources rarely
							contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief
							fragments. Inspired by the cycles of nature, the Egyptians saw
							time in the present as a series of recurring patterns, whereas the
							earliest periods of time were linear. Myths are set in these
							earliest times, and myth sets the pattern for the cycles of the
							present. Present events repeat the events of myth, and in doing so
							renew maat, the fundamental order of the universe. Amongst the
							most important episodes from the mythic past are the creation
							myths, in which the gods form the universe out of primordial
							chaos; the stories of the reign of the sun god Ra upon the earth;
							and the Osiris myth, concerning the struggles of the gods Osiris,
							Isis, and Horus against the disruptive god Set. Events from the
							present that might be regarded as myths include Ra's daily journey
							through the world and its otherworldly counterpart, the Duat.
							Recurring themes in these mythic episodes include the conflict
							between the upholders of maat and the forces of disorder, the
							importance of the pharaoh in maintaining maat, and the continual
							death and regeneration of the gods. The details of these sacred
							events differ greatly from one text to another and often seem
							contradictory. Egyptian myths are primarily metaphorical,
							translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that
							humans can understand. Each variant of a myth represents a
							different symbolic perspective, enriching the Egyptians'
							understanding of the gods and the world. Mythology profoundly
							influenced Egyptian culture. It inspired or influenced many
							religious rituals and provided the ideological basis for kingship.
							Scenes and symbols from myth appeared in art in tombs, temples,
							and amulets. In literature, myths or elements of them were used in
							stories that range from humor to allegory, demonstrating that the
							Egyptians adapted mythology to serve a wide variety of purposes.

						<p>
							The development of Egyptian myth is difficult to trace.
							Egyptologists must make educated guesses about its earliest
							phases, based on written sources that appeared much later.[1] One
							obvious influence on myth is the Egyptians' natural surroundings.
							Each day the sun rose and set, bringing light to the land and
							regulating human activity; each year the Nile flooded, renewing
							the fertility of the soil and allowing the highly productive
							farming that sustained Egyptian civilization. Thus the Egyptians
							saw water and the sun as symbols of life and thought of time as a
							series of natural cycles. This orderly pattern was at constant
							risk of disruption: unusually low floods resulted in famine, and
							high floods destroyed crops and buildings.[2] The hospitable Nile
							valley was surrounded by harsh desert, populated by peoples the
							Egyptians regarded as uncivilized enemies of order.[3] For these
							reasons, the Egyptians saw their land as an isolated place of
							stability, or maat, surrounded and endangered by chaos. These
							themes—order, chaos, and renewal—appear repeatedly in Egyptian
							religious thought.[4] Another possible source for mythology is
							ritual. Many rituals make reference to myths and are sometimes
							based directly on them.[5] But it is difficult to determine
							whether a culture's myths developed before rituals or vice
							versa.[6] Questions about this relationship between myth and
							ritual have spawned much discussion among Egyptologists and
							scholars of comparative religion in general. In ancient Egypt, the
							earliest evidence of religious practices predates written
							myths.[5] Rituals early in Egyptian history included only a few
							motifs from myth. For these reasons, some scholars have argued
							that, in Egypt, rituals emerged before myths.[6] But because the
							early evidence is so sparse, the question may never be resolved
							for certain.[5] In private rituals, which are often called
							"magical", the myth and the ritual are particularly closely tied.
							Many of the myth-like stories that appear in the rituals' texts
							are not found in other sources. Even the widespread motif of the
							goddess Isis rescuing her poisoned son Horus appears only in this
							type of text. The Egyptologist David Frankfurter argues that these
							rituals adapt basic mythic traditions to fit the specific ritual,
							creating elaborate new stories (called historiolas) based on
							myth.[7] In contrast, J. F. Borghouts says of magical texts that
							there is "not a shred of evidence that a specific kind of
							'unorthodox' mythology was coined... for this genre."[8] Much of
							Egyptian mythology consists of origin myths, explaining the
							beginnings of various elements of the world, including human
							institutions and natural phenomena. Kingship arises among the gods
							at the beginning of time and later passed to the human pharaohs;
							warfare originates when humans begin fighting each other after the
							sun god's withdrawal into the sky.[9] Myths also describe the
							supposed beginnings of less fundamental traditions. In a minor
							mythic episode, Horus becomes angry with his mother Isis and cuts
							off her head. Isis replaces her lost head with that of a cow. This
							event explains why Isis was sometimes depicted with the horns of a
							cow as part of her headdress.[10] Some myths may have been
							inspired by historical events. The unification of Egypt under the
							pharaohs, at the end of the Predynastic Period around 3100 BC,
							made the king the focus of Egyptian religion, and thus the
							ideology of kingship became an important part of mythology.[11] In
							the wake of unification, gods that were once local patron deities
							gained national importance, forming new relationships that linked
							the local deities into a unified national tradition. Geraldine
							Pinch suggests that early myths may have formed from these
							relationships.[12] Egyptian sources link the mythical strife
							between the gods Horus and Set with a conflict between the regions
							of Upper and Lower Egypt, which may have happened in the late
							Predynastic era or in the Early Dynastic Period.[13][Note 1] After
							these early times, most changes to mythology developed and adapted
							preexisting concepts rather than creating new ones, although there
							were exceptions.[14] Many scholars have suggested that the myth of
							the sun god withdrawing into the sky, leaving humans to fight
							among themselves, was inspired by the breakdown of royal authority
							and national unity at the end of the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 BC –
							2181 BC).[15] In the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), minor myths
							developed around deities like Yam and Anat who had been adopted
							from Canaanite religion. In contrast, during the Greek and Roman
							eras (332 BC–641 AD), Greco-Roman culture had little influence on
							Egyptian mythology.
