								<p>
									Norse or Scandinavian mythology is the body of myths of the
									North Germanic peoples, stemming from Norse paganism and
									continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia, and into
									the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The
									northernmost extension of Germanic mythology and stemming from
									Proto-Germanic folklore, Norse mythology consists of tales of
									various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous
									sources from both before and after the pagan period, including
									medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk
									tradition. The source texts mention numerous gods, such as the
									hammer-wielding, humanity-protecting thunder-god Thor, who
									relentlessly fights his foes; the one-eyed, raven-flanked god
									Odin, who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and
									bestowed among humanity the runic alphabet; the beautiful,
									seiðr-working, feathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides
									to battle to choose among the slain; the vengeful, skiing
									goddess Skaði, who prefers the wolf howls of the winter
									mountains to the seashore; the powerful god Njörðr, who may
									calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land; the god
									Freyr, whose weather and farming associations bring peace and
									pleasure to humanity; the goddess Iðunn, who keeps apples that
									grant eternal youthfulness; the mysterious god Heimdallr, who
									is born of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth,
									and possesses a resounding horn; the jötunn's son, the god
									Loki, who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death
									of the goddess Frigg's beautiful son Baldr; and numerous other
									deities. Most of the surviving mythology centers on the
									plights of the gods and their interaction with several other
									beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be
									friends, lovers, foes, or family members of the gods. The
									cosmos in Norse mythology consists of Nine Worlds that flank a
									central sacred tree, Yggdrasil. Units of time and elements of
									cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms
									of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created
									from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two
									humans are Ask and Embla. These worlds are foretold to be
									reborn after the events of Ragnarök when an immense battle
									occurs between the gods and their enemies, and the world is
									enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There the
									surviving gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and
									green, and two humans will repopulate the world. Norse
									mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since
									the 17th century, when key texts attracted the attention of
									the intellectual circles of Europe. By way of comparative
									mythology and historical linguistics, scholars have identified
									elements of Germanic mythology reaching as far back as
									Proto-Indo-European mythology. During the modern period, the
									Romanticist Viking revival re-awoke an interest in the subject
									matter, and references to Norse mythology may now be found
									throughout modern popular culture. The myths have further been
									revived in a religious context among adherents of Germanic
									Neopaganism.

									Central to accounts of Norse mythology are the plights of the
									gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as
									with the jötnar, who may be friends, lovers, foes, or family
									members of the gods. Numerous gods are mentioned in the source
									texts. As evidenced by records of personal names and place
									names, the most popular god among the Scandinavians during the
									Viking Age was Thor the thunder god, who is portrayed as
									unrelentingly pursuing his foes, his mountain-crushing,
									thunderous hammer Mjölnir in hand. In the mythology, Thor lays
									waste to numerous jötnar who are foes to the gods or humanity,
									and is wed to the beautiful, golden-haired goddess Sif.[18]
									The god Odin is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts.
									One-eyed, wolf- and raven-flanked, with spear in hand, Odin
									pursues knowledge throughout the worlds. In an act of
									self-sacrifice, Odin is described as having hanged himself
									upside-down for nine days and nights on the cosmological tree
									Yggdrasil to gain knowledge of the runic alphabet, which he
									passed on to humanity, and is associated closely with death,
									wisdom, and poetry. Odin is portrayed as the ruler of Asgard,
									and leader of the Aesir. Odin's wife is the powerful goddess
									Frigg who can see the future but tells no one, and together
									they have a beloved son, Baldr. After a series of dreams had
									by Baldr of his impending death, his death is engineered by
									Loki, and Baldr thereafter resides in Hel, a realm ruled over
									by an entity of the same name.[19] Odin must share half of his
									share of the dead with a powerful goddess, Freyja. She is
									beautiful, sensual, wears a feathered cloak, and practices
									seiðr. She rides to battle to choose among the slain and
									brings her chosen to her afterlife field Fólkvangr. Freyja
									weeps for her missing husband Óðr, and seeks after him in
									faraway lands.[20] Freyja's brother, the god Freyr, is also
									frequently mentioned in surviving texts, and in his
									association with the weather, royalty, human sexuality, and
									agriculture brings peace and pleasure to humanity. Deeply
									lovesick after catching sight of the beautiful jötunn Gerðr,
									Freyr seeks and wins her love, yet at the price of his future
									doom.[21] Their father is the powerful god Njörðr. Njörðr is
									strongly associated with ships and seafaring, and so also
									wealth and prosperity. Freyja and Freyr's mother is Njörðr's
									sister (her name is unprovided in the source material).
									However, there is more information about his pairing with the
									skiing and hunting goddess Skaði. Their relationship is
									ill-fated, as Skaði cannot stand to be away from her beloved
									mountains, nor Njörðr from the seashore.[22] Together, Freyja,
									Freyr, and Njörðr form a portion of gods known as the Vanir.
									While the Aesir and the Vanir retain distinct identification,
									they came together as the result of the Aesir–Vanir War.[23]
									While they receive less mention, numerous other gods and
									goddesses appear in the source material. (For a list of these
									deities, see List of Germanic deities.) Some of the gods heard
									less of include the apple-bearing goddess Iðunn and her
									husband, the skaldic god Bragi; the gold-toothed god
									Heimdallr, born of nine mothers; the ancient god Týr, who lost
									his right hand while binding the great wolf Fenrir; and the
									goddess Gefjon, who formed modern-day Zealand, Denmark.[24]
									Various beings outside of the gods are mentioned. Elves and
									dwarfs are commonly mentioned and appear to be connected, but
									their attributes are vague and the relation between the two is
									ambiguous. Elves are described as radiant and beautiful,
									whereas dwarfs often act as earthen smiths.[25] A group of
									beings variously described as jötnar, thursar, and trolls (in
									English these are all often glossed as "giants") frequently
									appear. These beings may either aid, deter, or take their
									place among the gods.[26] The norns, dísir, and aforementioned
									valkyries also receive frequent mention. While their functions
									and roles may overlap and differ, all are collective female
									beings associated with fate
